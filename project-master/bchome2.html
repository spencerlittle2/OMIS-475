        <center><h2>Scholarship Recipient</h2></center>
        <p>I had never before recieved a scholarship in school which was super wierd to me because they have one for literally everything nowadays. I was realy lazy coming out of high school when it came to applying for scholarships so i missed out on a ton of free money. Here at NIU, they have a great system where you fill out an general form application and it send sit to very scholarship offered at the university. I receievd a letter last april saying that i recieved the CAN/AZEL Memorial scholarship and i was very excited! It was a blessing that someone chose me out of other students so i was really grateful.  </p>

        <center><h2>Built my own database</h2></center>
        <p>During my OMIS 452 class, we built a database based off of our own ideas. Mine was based on a medical database that patients could linked all their information into that way during visits, they would not have to go through the paperwork every time. I never did that before so this was a major accomplishment for me. </p>
