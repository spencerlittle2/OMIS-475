<h1>Migos</h1>
<p>My current favorite musical group is Migos.  The type of music that Migos produces can be considered hip hop.</p>
<p>I enjoy listening to Migos because I believe their style is unique.  My music playlist is very diverse and I do not only listen to this group.</p>

	<dt>Culture</dt>
    <dd>This album is the first of the Culture series by Migos.  Culture was released in 2017 and it was considered a breakout album.  This album features the most hit songs.  Of these three album reviews I would consider this the best.</dd>
    <dt>Culture II</dt>
    <dd>This album was not as successful as the first Culture album.  Culture II was released in early 2018.  Migos tried to copy the style of the top songs from the first Culture album but did not have as much success.  Of these three albums I would rank Culture II the second best.</dd>
    <dt>YRN 2</dt>
    <dd>The album is different than the Culture series.  The style of this album was more rap than hip hop.  The emphasis was about the wording rather than about the album.  Of the three ablums reviewed I would rank this third.</dd>
