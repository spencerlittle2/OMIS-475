    <h1><strong>Spencer's love story for hockey</strong></h1>
    <p>My interest for ice hockey started at a young age.  My parents taught me how to ice skate when I was around 5 years old.  While growing up it was common for my siblings and I to ice skate on frozen winter ponds or at the local park district.  My interest for ice skating grew into a passion for the Chicago Blackhawks.     </p>
